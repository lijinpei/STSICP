applicative order: forever loop<br/>
normal-order: evaluate to 0<br/>
both mit-scheme and chez-scheme seems to use applicative-order<br/>

because short of short-circuit evaluation(and applicative order evaluation), the new-if creates a forever loop.<br/>
With chez-scheme, the program exits when it runs out of memory.<br/>
With mit-scheme, the program exits immediately on encountering the first sqrt-iter evaluation.<br/>

For small values, a fixed precision won't guatantee guess and x are close enough.<br/>
For large values, even guess and x and close enough, they may not pass the "close-enough?" test because limited float point precision.<br/>
```scheme
(define (relative-close-enough? guess x) (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) (* guess 0.0001)))
```

```scheme
(define (delta-close-enough? old-guess guess) (< (abs (- old-guess guess)) 0.0001))
